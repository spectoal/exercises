  <p>Tags have angle brackets, < and >, and "wrap" around text to make elements. The frontslash character
leans forward: /. Elements can have attributes;
    <span style="color: rebeccapurple;">
    this span has a style attribute.
</span>
P tags are for paragraphs. Strong and em tags make text <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>,
respectively. Likewise, you can use sup and sub tags make test <sup>superscript</sup>, or
<sub>subscript</sub>, or q tags for short <q>quotes</q>.</p>
    <blockquote>
        You should use blokequote tags for long quotations, <br>
        a br tag for a line break, and an hr tag for a horizontal rule.<br>
        These are known as self-closing, because they don't have closing tag.
